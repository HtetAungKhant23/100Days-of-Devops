Script Execution Permissions
============================

- On Linux/Unix systems, every file has permissions that control what users can do with it:

- 1. Read (r) -> view the contents.

- 2. Write (w) -> modify the file.

- 3. Execute (x) -> run the file as a program/script.



chmod
=====

- We can use "chmod" (change mode) command to change file or directory permissions in Linux/Unix. 


- Permissions apply to:

- 1. u -> user (owner)

- 2. g -> group

- 3. o -> others (everyone else)

- 4. a -> all (u + g + o)


- Operators:

-  1. + -> add permission 
-  2. - -> remove permission 
-  3. = -> set only permission 



Example:

chmod u+x hello.sh   # add execute permission for user
chmod g-w hello.sh   # remove write permission from group
chmod o=r hello.sh   # set others to read-only
chmod a+x hello.sh   # give execute permission to everyone
